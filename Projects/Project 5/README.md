This investigation aims to explore and analyze correlations between the prosper loans and APR that the loan takers will recieve. The parameters of focus is the loan amount, APR (Annual Percentage Rate), loan rate, occupation, loan status, employment status. Other parameters that helped the analysis are income and monthly loan payment.

- The spread of the APR is more tangible for lower incomes and denser the more you earn based on how much you pay each month back in mortgage and rate.

- The non-informational category "Other" in the "Occupation" variable are among the top loan takers in this dataset. The category Professional, Computer programmer, Executive, Teacher and Analyst are among the top 5 loan takers. These categories are more prone to take a loan than other categories.
